# Dashboard Changelog

Format: newest first.

## scanner v1.498.0 — 26 Sep 2026

**Fixed a rule I missed.** The exit-rule layer (below) had defaulted the 10 PSX paper-book names to "no data" instead of trying the dashboard's own standing PSX price source (TradingView). Fixed: PSX names now get the same trailing-stop check as the ETF holdings on **Tabs 1–2** (price vs 50-day average) — but with a real overbought check too, since TradingView also supplies RSI for these names, something the ETF holdings don't have. A genuine feed failure still shows honestly as "no data" rather than being hidden.

## scanner v1.497.0 + index v5.383 — 26 Sep 2026

**Four-item wave + a labeling fix.** (1) Fixed the run-timing math so it can never report an impossible negative number for unaccounted time, on **any tab that shows scan diagnostics**. (2) Checked whether the SEC insider-filing check runs too often — it doesn't; left alone. (3) Added a concentration cap on **Tab 19** so one sector can't fill the whole "buy today" list. (4) Built the exit-rule layer: every held or paper-tracked position on **Tabs 1–2 and Tab 17** now carries a HOLD / TRIM / EXIT signal with a trailing stop, labeled by how much data backs it. (5) Fixed a mislabeling on **Tab 19** where stocks freshly hitting a 52-week high were wrongly called "repairing" because of an old, unrelated all-time high.

--- Each entry names the scanner and/or index version, the date, and what changed in plain language, with the tab it affects. This file was not staged during the last several deploys — the entries below back-fill that gap from the actual `SCAN_VERSION` / `index.html v` strings shipped, cross-checked against the live `data.json` after each run.

## scanner v1.496.0 + index v5.382 — 26 Sep 2026

**Verdict-on-completed-bar fix + stable demotion flag.** A two-run audit caught two real bugs:
- The daily BUY/WAIT/AVOID call on **Tab 19** was still reading the live, mid-session price tick instead of yesterday's settled close — so a name could flip from BUY to WAIT and back within the same afternoon with no new trading day. Fixed: the verdict is now recomputed once the settled daily bar lands, and the technical card states plainly when the live tick disagrees with the settled call ("the settled verdict is WAIT... the live tick alone would read AVOID — shown for comparison only").
- The rule that penalizes a "trend damaged" name in the ranking was matching on a snippet of sentence text, which meant a one-cent price tick could silently flip whether a stock got penalized at all (found on DVN). Fixed in **two places** — the main ranking and the paper-book sizing — to key off a stable internal flag instead of the sentence.

## scanner v1.495.0 — 25 Sep 2026

**Fixed the same-run re-ranking I shipped the day before.** The v1.494.0 fix (below) called the re-ranking function 24 lines before the data it needed was actually saved, so it silently ran on empty data every time — 13 stocks flagged AVOID on **Tab 19** stayed ranked as if nothing were wrong. One-line fix: moved the call to after the data exists. Confirmed on the next live run: 0 inconsistent names, down from 13.

## scanner v1.494.0 + index v5.381 — 25 Sep 2026

**Entry-trigger correctness fix.** The three-condition buy trigger added in v1.493.0 (below) was comparing the day's price and volume against a full-day average while the market was still open — so every single recommended stock showed volume at 10–30% of normal and none could ever trigger. Fixed: the three conditions now judge the **last completed daily bar**, not the live tick; the technical card on **Tab 19** states which bar it judged and shows the live price separately, labelled "now (intraday)". Also added: the cash line now says how many positions your deployable cash actually covers at the sized amount, and the "Actionable today" cards are ordered closest-to-buy first.

## scanner v1.493.0 + index v5.380 — 25 Sep 2026

**Entry-trigger layer (owner-requested) + a regression fix.** Added the three-condition entry trigger to **Tab 19**: (1) price in a pullback or breakout zone, (2) a daily close above the prior day's high, (3) volume above the 30-day average — all three met shows TRIGGERED, with a sized buy plan (dollars, shares, stop, two tranches) computed from the live cash figures on **Tab 17**. Also fixed a regression from the prior build (v1.492.0) that had silently blanked the entire Recommended Stocks list on **Tab 19** — a miskeyed dictionary entry caused the ranking function to fail in 3 milliseconds with no visible error.

## scanner v1.492.0 + index v5.379 — 25 Sep 2026

**Decision wave — coherence, calibration, and the "Actionable today" strip.** (1) The falling-knife / insider-selling penalties that were only ever shown on **Tab 19** now live inside the ranking itself, so the number and the label can never disagree. (2) A calibration loop: while the TCE engine's HIGH-conviction tier is still 0-for-10 on its own scorecard (**Tab 9**), its vote in the ranking is discounted. (3) The paper-book model portfolios (**Tabs 1–2**) now obey the same penalties. (4–9) Efficiency and housekeeping: the MOAT-holdings fetch (**Tab 22**) skips funds that have returned nothing for two runs running, off-exchange pricing and ETF fee lookups go through TradingView first, and the stale bank-sector data notice on **Tab 11** now states its own age. (10) A new "Actionable today" strip on **Tab 19**: the handful of names that clear every gate at once — engine agreement, quality grade, buy timing, and not flagged — with a concentration line showing where the live book (**Tab 17**) is piled up by sector and theme.
